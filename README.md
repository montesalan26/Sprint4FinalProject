This is a project analizing different types of cars out in the market. This project is a tool to simulate and put in practice my recent learnings from my course that i am taking. It is not using real information. To be able to run this program, you must import the following libraries:



import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import altair as alt
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
